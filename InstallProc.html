<p><b>Step 4: Tweak browser</b><br />
When running github, often there are uplaoads and downloads between github and the computer
<p>Most browsers will automatically download to the <b>Downloads</b> folder
<br />This means that Harvey will then have to move the files around on the computer using </b>File Explorer</b>.
<p>Doing this frequently will distract Harvey while writing his codes. 
<p>To make it easier, the browser preference should be set to <b>Ask user to direct download folders</b>
